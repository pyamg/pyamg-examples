The smoothed aggregation solver supports complex arithmetc and
there is no conversion to an equivalent real system.  For example, the
highlighted demo here generates a basic gauge Laplacian from quantum
chromodynamics and solves the system for a random right-hand side and random
initial guess.
   
Using
```
python demo.py --solver 1
```
results in the following.
