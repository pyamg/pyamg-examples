In this example we look at a 2D DG discretization of a Poisson problem.
The mesh consists of 46 elements, with p=5, leading to 21 degrees of freedom
per element.  The first figure shows that aggregation is local, leading to
a continuous first level.  The first coarse level (level1) candidate vector `B` is
also shown.
