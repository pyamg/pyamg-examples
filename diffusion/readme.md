This demo considers different strength measures in the SA-AMG setup phase for
finite element (Q1) discretizations of anisotropic diffusion.  In particular,
the Classic Strength Measure is compared to the Evolution Measure.  For this
example, we see that total work is reduced by using the Evolution Measure and
that a scalable convergence rate is observed with rootnode:
