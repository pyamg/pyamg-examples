In this example, the first-level aggregates are shown for AMG based on smoothed aggregation.
An example mesh and adjacency matrix is loaded from `square.mat`, followed by a call to
`smoothed_aggregation_solver`.  Then the first-level aggregates are
plotted. From the figure, most aggregates encompass entire groups of
elements in the underlying mesh. Still, there are a many aggregates that yield
"strings" in the aggregation, often impacting performance.
