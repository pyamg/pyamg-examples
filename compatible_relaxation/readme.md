The C/F splitting---i.e. the splitting of indices into strictly coarse nodes (C-pts)
and strictly fine nodes (F-pts)---using Compatible Relaxation is illustrated in this
example.  A 2d finite-difference matrix of the Poisson problem is used and the
coarse and fine splitting is plotted.  Coarse nodes are
highlighted orange, while fine nodes are highlighted blue.  In this case, the
coarsening is not aggressive, resulting in a coarsening-by-two.
