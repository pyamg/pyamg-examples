This demo highlights using PyAMG's `blackbox` module, which attempts to solve
an arbitrary system `A x = b` with minimal input.  The matrix `A` can be
non-Hermitian, indefinite, Hermitian positive-definite, etc...  The method tries
generic and
robust settings for `smoothed_aggregation_solver(..)`.  If
`solve()` fails to effectively solve the system,
then it may be helpful to look at the demo in `solver_diagonstics`
for guidance on automatically finding better parameter settings.

To use `solve()`, only the matrix `A` and a right-hand side `b` are needed:

```python
x = pyamg.solve(A, b, verb=True)
```
The demo produces residual norms that can vary from machine to machine.
